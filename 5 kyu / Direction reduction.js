/*Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South.
The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.
The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction {North, East, West, South}.
See more examples in "Sample Tests:"
Notes
Not all paths can be made simpler. The path ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"] is not reducible. "NORTH"*/

function dirReduc(arr){
    const opposites = {'NORTH': 'SOUTH', 'EAST': 'WEST', 'SOUTH': 'NORTH', 'WEST': 'EAST'};
    const result = []
    arr.forEach(item => {
        if(result.length) {
            const prevItem = result.pop()
            if(prevItem !== opposites[item]) {
                result.push(prevItem)
                result.push(item)
            }
        } else {
            result.push(item)
        }
